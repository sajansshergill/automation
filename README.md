# AI-Powered Workflow Automation for Internal Ticketing

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To build an automated system that classifies and routes internal IT/maintenance tickets using a Large Language Model (LLM) API like OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4, simulating an internal operations tool for a company like FreeAxez.

This project reflects FreeAxezâ€™s interest in:

Cross-functional AI collaboration

Building "vibe coding" tools non-technical teams can use

Automating business operations

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement
Operations teams often receive a large volume of unstructured issue reports (emails, form submissions, Slack messages). Manual triaging is inefficient and prone to delays. The goal is to create an intelligent assistant that automatically tags the issue type and routes it to the appropriate department head.
